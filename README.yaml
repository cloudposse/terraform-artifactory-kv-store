  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl

  module "example" {
    source  = "cloudposse/kv-store/artifactory"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    set = {
      "key1" = {value = "value1", sensative = false }
      "key2" = {value = "value2", sensative = true }
    }
