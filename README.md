This module is a key/value store for storing configuration data that should be shared among terraform root
modules. The backend for this key/value store is a generic Artifactory repository.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Introduction






## Usage

For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

```hcl

module "example" {
  source  = "cloudposse/kv-store/artifactory"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  set = {
    "key1" = {value = "value1", sensative = false }
    "key2" = {value = "value2", sensative = true }
  }

  context = module.label.this
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.

|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| <a name="input_artifactory_auth_token"></a> [artifactory\_auth\_token](#input\_artifactory\_auth\_token) | The authentication token to use when accessing artifactory. Getting this value from the environment is supported<br>with JFROG\_ACCESS\_TOKEN or ARTIFACTORY\_ACCESS\_TOKEN variables. | `string` | n/a | yes |

| <a name="input_get"></a> [get](#input\_get) | A map of keys to read from the key/value store. The key\_path, namespace,<br>tenant, stage, environment, and name are derived from context by default,<br>but can be overridden by specifying a value in the map. | <pre>map(object(<br>    {<br>      key_path   = optional(string),<br>      properties = optional(map(string))<br>    }<br>    )<br>  )</pre> | `{}` | no |

| <a name="input_key_label_order"></a> [key\_label\_order](#input\_key\_label\_order) | The order in which the labels (ID elements) appear in the full key path. For example, if you want a key path to<br>look like /{namespace}/{tenant}/{stage}/{environment}/name, you would set this varibale to<br>["namespace", "tenant", "stage", "environment", "name"]. | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_key_prefix"></a> [key\_prefix](#input\_key\_prefix) | The prefix to use for the key path. This is useful for storing all keys for a module under a common prefix. | `string` | `""` | no |
| <a name="input_set"></a> [set](#input\_set) | A map of key-value pairs to write to the key/value store. The key\_path,<br>namespace, tenant, stage, environment, and name are derived from context by<br>default, but can be overridden by specifying a value in the map. | <pre>map(object(<br>    {<br>      key_path   = optional(string),<br>      value      = string,<br>      sensitive  = bool,<br>      properties = optional(map(string))<br>    }<br>    )<br>  )</pre> | `{}` | no |
